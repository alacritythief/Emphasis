Emphasis
========

Emphasis is an animation framework, as well as a content management system for webcomics built with Ruby on Rails.

It is planned to be a "Breakable Toy" project for Launch Academy.

This is currently a work-in-progress, so do not expect it to be functioning until October 2014.

More to come.
